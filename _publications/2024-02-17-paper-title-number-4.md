## Abstract
This research explores the impact of oscillating shock wave-boundary layer interactions (SWBLI) in hypersonic flows using numerical simulations. A flat plate model is subjected to shock waves generated by an oscillating wedge at 5.8 Mach with varying frequencies (47 Hz, 80 Hz, 100 Hz). The study reveals critical insights into incipient angles for boundary layer separation, pressure distribution, and shock bubble formation. Dynamic meshing and user-defined functions (UDF) are employed to replicate real-world oscillatory conditions, offering valuable data for thermal protection systems and hypersonic vehicle design.

## Introduction
Hypersonic shock wave-boundary layer interactions pose challenges in designing air-breathing hypersonic vehicles, such as scramjets. These interactions result in localized heating, boundary layer separation, and pressure variations. This study investigates the dynamic behavior of SWBLI, focusing on the effects of varying shock generator frequencies on flow characteristics and separation phenomena.

## Problem Statement
The transient and oscillatory nature of SWBLI in hypersonic regimes can lead to:
- Boundary layer separation and reattachment.
- Localized heating and pressure peaks.
- Operational inefficiencies in hypersonic vehicles.

This research aims to address these issues by analyzing the impact of oscillation frequencies on SWBLI dynamics.

## Methodology
### Geometry and Meshing
- A 2D geometry with a wedge shock generator and flat plate was designed in SolidWorks.
- ANSYS Meshing was used to refine the computational grid to achieve mesh independence.

### CFD Simulations
- Simulations were conducted in ANSYS Fluent using the realizable k-ε turbulence model.
- Transient simulations incorporated UDFs for oscillating shock generator motion.

### Validation
- Results were validated against experimental data, achieving high agreement.

## Results and Discussion
### Steady-State Analysis
- Identified key flow features: impinging shock, separation shock, expansion fan, and reattachment shock.
- Calculated incipient angle (4.7°) for boundary layer separation.

### Transient Analysis
- Modeled shock generator oscillations at 47 Hz, 80 Hz, and 100 Hz.
- Observed variations in shock bubble length and pressure distribution.
- Identified dynamic flow characteristics, such as oscillation-induced boundary layer transitions.

### Mesh Independence Study
- Demonstrated negligible differences between medium and fine meshes, ensuring computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.

## Conclusion
- Oscillating SWBLI influences hypersonic flow characteristics significantly.
- Incipient angles and shock bubble dynamics are sensitive to oscillation frequency.
- Findings contribute to the development of advanced thermal protection and aerodynamic control systems in hypersonic vehicles.

## Significance
This research enhances understanding of hypersonic SWBLI under oscillatory conditions, providing a foundation for future studies on flow control and thermal management in extreme environments. It bridges gaps in SWBLI modeling, offering practical insights for aerospace engineers.
