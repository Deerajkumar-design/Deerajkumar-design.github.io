## Abstract
This study explores innovative cooling strategies for electronic components, focusing on cross flow and jet impingement techniques with and without phase change material (PCM). Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the research evaluates thermal performance, including temperature reduction, Nusselt number enhancement, and pressure drop. Results demonstrate that cross flow offers superior thermal management, reducing temperatures by 14.5°C compared to jet impingement. Incorporating PCM further lowers operating temperatures by an average of 7.5°C and 6.1°C for cross flow and jet impingement techniques, respectively, showcasing its effectiveness in electronic cooling.

## Introduction
The miniaturization and increased power densities in electronic components necessitate efficient thermal management solutions. Traditional methods like forced air convection often fall short, prompting the exploration of advanced heat sinks. This research investigates the thermal characteristics of pin fin heat sinks under two configurations—cross flow and jet impingement—and examines the impact of PCM on performance.

## Problem Statement
Efficient heat dissipation is critical for maintaining the longevity and performance of electronic components. This study aims to:
- Compare cross flow and jet impingement cooling methods.
- Evaluate the effect of PCM on thermal characteristics.
- Identify the optimal cooling strategy for reduced base temperatures and improved heat transfer.

## Methodology
### Computational Domain
3D geometrical models were developed for the heat sinks using SolidWorks and discretized with ICEM CFD. Cross flow, jet impingement, and PCM techniques were modeled with detailed boundary conditions.

### CFD Simulation
Ansys Fluent was used for solving heat transfer equations. Realizable k-ε turbulence modeling ensured accurate predictions for convective heat transfer.

### Validation
Numerical results were validated against experimental data, showing deviations within acceptable limits (3.7% for cross flow and 5.06% for jet impingement).

## Results and Discussion
### Cross Flow vs. Jet Impingement
- Cross flow demonstrated superior performance, with 41.1% higher Nusselt numbers and 14.5°C lower base temperatures than jet impingement.
- Jet impingement showed higher pressure drops and pumping power requirements, making it less efficient.

### Effect of PCM
- PCM reduced base temperatures significantly, particularly at lower Reynolds numbers, by utilizing latent heat storage.
- Cross flow with PCM consistently outperformed jet impingement, maintaining lower thermal resistance and operating temperatures.

### Validation and Contours
- Temperature and velocity contours highlighted better cooling distribution in cross flow.
- Jet impingement created localized cooling zones, leading to non-uniform heat dissipation.

## Conclusion
- Cross flow cooling, combined with PCM, is a highly efficient thermal management strategy for electronic components.
- PCM enhances heat sink performance by reducing peak operating temperatures and stabilizing thermal profiles.
- The study confirms the importance of advanced cooling techniques in addressing challenges posed by high-power-density electronic systems.

## Significance
This research provides critical insights into advanced cooling methodologies, contributing to the development of more efficient and compact thermal management systems. The findings hold implications for industries requiring reliable cooling solutions for high-performance electronics.
